This project implements a sophisticated ReAct (Actor-Critic) Agent enhanced with a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for handling insurance policy queries. The system combines the reasoning capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM) with the precision of retrieved context from insurance documentation.
